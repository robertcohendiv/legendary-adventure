      <h1>Terms of Service - MACMIM</h1>
      <p>(Making A Cat's Money Intelligently Managed)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Purr-spective clients agree that all investments made with MACMIM are at their own risk and that cats are not known for their financial savvy.
        </li>
        <li>
          MACMIM will not be held responsible for any lost “whiskers” or “lives” resulting from investment decisions made by our feline financial advisors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients must provide a steady supply of catnip and belly rubs to maintain their advisor's focus on their investments.
        </li>
        <li>
          MACMIM reserves the right to use client funds for impromptu catnip parties and napping on keyboard moments.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event of a financial crisis, MACMIM may seek comfort in boxes and chase laser pointers instead of finding a solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          MACMIM is not responsible for any investment-related damage to furniture, curtains, or any other household item that may fall prey to a mischievous feline advisor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Purr-spective clients must acknowledge that their investment portfolio may include a disproportionate amount of cat toy stocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          MACMIM is not affiliated with any other financial institutions, except for maybe the local mouse banking system.
        </li>
        <li>
          By investing with MACMIM, clients agree to allow their feline advisors unlimited access to their laps for napping purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Past performance is not indicative of future results, especially when napping is involved.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      
      <p>
        Disclaimer: This is a joke and not a real investment company. Please do not invest real money with MACMIM or any other similar fake companies. Always thoroughly research and consult with a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
